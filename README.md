**Forking and/or downloading this repo only makes sense:**

 - if you want to get a knowledge about the internals of SikuliX
 - if you want to create your own packages containing SikuliX features
 - if you want to contribute.

**BE AWARE** The use for scripting and Java programming is only possible after the first nightly builds are available. Currently you might fork the project and make your tests in the project context. Issues and pull requests are only accepted here on Github.

 - the new public features are in **com.sikulix.api**
 - the current API (up to 1.1.x) in **org.sikuli.script** will be kept for backwards compatibility, but rerouted to **com.sikulix.api/core** as needed
 - new projects using Java should use the API as provided by **com.sikulix.api**

Prerequisites for development and testing
---

 - a Java JDK 1.8
 - Maven 3+
 - only 64-Bit Systems supported

**For developement I use the [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com)**

 - **[IntelliJ IDEA CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** for Java and everything else
 - **[PyCharm CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)** for special Jython/Python stuff
 - **[RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/)** for special JRuby/Ruby stuff (special license for OpenSource projects)
 
Be aware for development and testing

 - the so called folder `SikulixAppData`, where SikuliX specific stuff is stored once per machine, for SikuliX2 now is `SikulixAppData/SX2` to allow the parallel usage of SikuliX1 and SikuliX2 on the same machine.
